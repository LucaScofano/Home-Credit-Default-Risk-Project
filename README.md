# Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Project
## Part of the class "Fundamentals of Data Science", the repository in question contains the final project.

### Description of the project:
We are given 7 different datasets with multiple features each. The main goal
is to predict whether a new individual will be able to repay the loan or not.
We tackled different steps to achieve our goal:

1. Importing all the datasets

2. Quick analysis of the main datasets

3.Feature Engineering as well as One hot encoding

4.Cross- validation model (K-fold)

5.Light GBM model and ROC-AUC score
